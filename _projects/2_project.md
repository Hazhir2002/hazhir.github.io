Collaborated with Hotiday to develop a responsive and performance-driven front end for their website using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and PostCSS. Leveraged modern web development practices to ensure a seamless user experience and visually appealing design.

This project highlighted my expertise in frontend development, attention to detail, and ability to deliver quality results that align with client expectations.
